# Assignment 2: Stream File Handling

## Description
This Node.js project copies data from `input.txt` to `output.txt` using streams and then reads and displays the content of `output.txt` line by line on the console.

## Project Structure
- `index.js`: Main script that handles copying and reading file data.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- `input.txt` file with 500 words of random content.
- An empty `output.txt` file.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the `index.js` file.
2. Create `input.txt` with random content and an empty `output.txt` file in the project directory.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

### Running the Project
1. Run the following command to execute the `index.js` file:
```bash
node index.js
```

### Expected Output
The script will:

1. Copy data from ```input.txt``` to ```output.txt``` using streams.

2. Read and display the content of ```output.txt``` line by line on the console.

### Error Handling
The script checks for the existence of ```input.txt``` and logs an error message if the file does not exist.

### Sample Output
```txt
<Content of output.txt line by line>
```
